# MiniVP Pan-HT

## Components

Required components :

* Arduino (tested with Uno R3 and Pro Mini)
* TSL2561 luxmeter

Optional components :

* PCF8563 real-time clock  
  *Enable or disable RTC using the `#define USE_RTC` statement*
* SD or microSD card reader  
  *Enable or disable SD support using the `#define USE_SD` statement*

## Pinout

The SD CS and LED pins can be defined using the `SD_CS_PIN` and `LED_PIN` preprocessor directives, respectively.

## Setup

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Move the contents of the `libraries/` folder into your Arduino IDE libraries folder.
3. Open `Pan_HT.ino` in the Arduino IDE.
4. Edit the `SD_CS_PIN` and `LED_PIN` constants if you need to move those pins.
6. (Un)comment the `USE_SD`, `USE_RTC`, `DEBUG` constants if you need to enable or disable specific features.
7. Load the firmware onto the Arduino.
8. Have fun

# Troubleshooting

* **The LED turns on, then blinks twice in a loop** : The real-time clock reports an incorrect status. Check the RTC is properly connected and its date/time information is properly set.
* **The LED turns on, then blinks 4 times in a loop** : The SD card initialization failed. Check the pinout and connection to the SD card reader and check the SD card is properly plugged in and works on another device.
* **The LED turns on, then blinks 8 times in a loop** : The SD card was properly initialized but the `DATA.CSV` file could not be opened. Check that the card or file is not read-only, that there is still some disk space on the card, and that the card is properly formatted in FAT16 or FAT32 format as per the [Arduino recommendations](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/SDCardNotes).
* **The LED turns on and does not turn off** : The Arduino is stuck while trying to initialize either the real-time clock or the sensor. Check their pinouts and connections and try again.

By enabling the `DEBUG` preprocessor directive, you will be able to get logs sent back to you, particularly during the initialization process, that may be useful for troubleshooting the board.

# Controlling via serial

By enabling the `USE_JUMPER` preprocessor directive, you can let the station enter a special "remote control" mode over serial when booting it with a wire between D2 and D3 (`JUMPER_IN_PIN` and `JUMPER_OUT_PIN`).

Once done, open a serial connection to the Arduino (using the Arduino IDE's serial monitor, or `screen`, `minicom`, `picocom`, Visual Studio Code's Arduino extension, `echo` and `cat`, HyperTerminal, PuTTY, etc.). You can then send commands to the station:

* `PING` : A simple test command that should send `PONG` back.
* `ID` : Will return the station's ID, formatted as `PAN-L-X-Y-Z`:
  * `X` is the revision number (currently, revision A) ;
  * `Y` is the unique serial number of the station ;
  * `Z` is the frequency, in seconds, of data gathering. For Pan-UV, it defaults to 300.
  Example : `PAN-L-A-42-600` is a Pan-HT weather station revision A with serial number 42 and collecting data every 10 minutes.
* `GET` : Get a single line of CSV output, just like what would be saved by the station when running normally.

If the firmware was compiled with the `USE_RTC` directive, the following commands are also available:

* `TIMESTAMP` : Get a UNIX timestamp or a ISO 8601 date/time without timezones (`yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss`) for the currently set date/time on the station ;
* `DATE <YYYY> <MM> <DD>` : Allows to set the current date on the station's real-time clock. For example, `DATE 2001 09 11` will set the date to September 11th, 2001 ;
* `TIME <HH> <MM> <SS>` : Allows to set the current time on the station's real-time clock, in 24-hour format. For example, `TIME 06 09 42` will set the time to 6:09:42 AM.

If the firmware was compiled with the `USE_SD` directive, the following commands are also available:

* `HARVEST` : Get all the records that were stored on the SD card, without altering it ;
* `CLEAR` : Remove all the stored records from the SD card.
