# MiniVP Pan

A set of autonomous single-sensor stations designed to last long.

* Pan-HT : *Humidity-Temperature*, uses DHT-11, DHT-21 or DHT-22 (AM2301, AM2302, AM2320, AM2321) sensors to record relative humidity and temperature every few minutes
* Pan-L : *Light* : uses a photoresistor to record light levels every few minutes
* Pan-UV : *UltraViolet* : uses a UV sensor to record UV index every few minutes

See the README files inside those folders to get more information about each station.
